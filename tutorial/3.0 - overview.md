# Prereqs
- npm and nodejs accessible from the terminal
- Stage 2 cloned: https://github.com/andrewdownie/react-frontend-series

# Notes
* If a step starts with "Fill in", "Hook up" or "Add more" the related code is in a file in this folder.
* To keep this tutorial simpler, instead of connecting to a backend api using fetch, we will instead read/write from localStorage  
    * samples on how to make async fetch requests to actual apis will also be provided
* I am planning of adding more explaination of what is being added after I have the entirety of this tutorial series layed out

# Tutorial
1. Open the stage 2 tutorial in VSCode  
2. Open the VSCode terminal
3. install the following npm packages:  
    a. npm i redux-saga
    b. make sure the dependencies from previous steps are installed with the command 'npm i'
4. Create a folder in src called 'sagas'
5. Create 3 files in src/sagas  
    a. src/sagas/index.js
    b. src/sagas/categories.js
    c. src/sagas/todos.js
6. Add more actions to src/actions/index.js to handle async loading of state. There new actions will signal that the async operation has completed, and the existing actions will be used to trigger the async operation.  
    a. ADD_TODO_COMPLETE  
    b. DELETE_TODO_COMPLETE  
    c. TOGGLE_TODO_COMPLETE  
    d. ADD_CATEGORY_COMPLETE  
    e. DELETE_CATEGORY_COMPLETE  
    f. LOAD_CATEGORIES_COMPLETE  
    g. LOAD_TODOS_COMPLETE
7. Fill in src/sagas/index.js to create the root saga
8. Hook up src/index.js to redux-saga and the root saga we just created
9. Fill in src/sagas/categories.js
10. Fill in src/sagas/todos.js
11. Hook up the new actions in src/reducers/todos.js
12. Hook up the new actions in src/reducers/categories.js
13. Hook up the new actions in src/reducers/selectedCategory.js
